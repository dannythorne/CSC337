Parallelize the 2D heat equation solver.

First extend the domain in only one direction so that processes communicate
only in the one direction. Do it in the direction corresponding to the side
with entries that are contiguous in memory.

Then allow 2D partitioning with communication in both directions. For the sides
with entries that are not contiguous in memory, first just copy them to an
auxiliary array for communication. Then figure out how to define an MPI derived
data type so that those entries can be communicated directly from the 2D array.
